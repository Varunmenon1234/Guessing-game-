Explanation of Random Number Generation Lines in C

1. srand(time(NULL));
This line sets (or seeds) the random number generator.
- time(NULL) returns the current time in seconds, which is always changing.
- Using that value ensures that the sequence of random numbers generated will be different every time the program is run.
If srand() is not used, rand() will generate the same sequence of numbers each time the program runs.
Think of srand() as shuffling a deck before drawing cards.

2. random = (rand() % 100) + 1;
This line generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- rand() gives a large random number.
- % 100 reduces that number to the range 0 to 99.
- + 1 shifts the range to 1 to 100.
So the result is a properly generated random number from 1 to 100.

Original Line vs Corrected Line:
Original (Incorrect):
    random = rand() * 100 + 1;
This produces a very large number and does NOT limit the output to between 1 and 100.

Correct (Recommended):
    random = (rand() % 100) + 1;
This ensures the number is always in the correct range.

Summary:
- srand(time(NULL)) ensures randomness varies between program runs.
- (rand() % 100) + 1 correctly defines the random number range.
